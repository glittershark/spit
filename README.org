#+begin_src
Watch out, they spit!
  - The genie
#+end_src

Some kind of Lisp interpreter in OCaml.

This repository contains literally the first lines of OCaml I've ever written
(ever!), so it might be truly awful. Let's see what happens here

* Demo

#+begin_src
❯ dune exec bin/main.exe
spit -> (.def x 1)
nil

spit -> x
1

spit -> (+ x x)
2

spit -> (+ x x 4)
6

spit -> (defun* plus-1 (x) (+ x 1))
nil

spit -> (plus-1 1)
2
#+end_src
