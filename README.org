Watch out, they spit!
  - The genie
#+end_quote

Some kind of Lisp interpreter in OCaml.

This repository contains literally the first lines of OCaml I've ever written
(ever!), so it might be truly awful. Let's see what happens here

* Demo

#+begin_src
❯ dune exec bin/main.exe
spit -> (.def x 1)
Nil

spit -> x
(Int 1)

spit -> (+ x x)
(Int 2)

spit -> (+ x x 4)
(Int 6)

spit -> (.def plus-1 (.lambda x (+ (car x) 1)))
Nil

spit -> (plus-1 1)
(Int 2)
#+end_src
